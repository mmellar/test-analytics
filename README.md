# test-analytics

Based on Google's 'Test Analytics' tool described here...

http://googletesting.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/google-test-analytics-now-in-open.html

This is a de-facto fork of the original as Google Code is a bit defunct, and the code needed a bit of TLC (capabilities grid didn't work for one).

High level objectives for my work on this are...

1) Find and fix bugs.
2) Decouple from Google App Engine and enable on-site hosting.
3) Define + develop new useful features.
4) Develop useful integrations with other code/project management systems (Git/Gerrit, Jenkins, Jira etc)
5) ???
6) Better quality software

Pull requests apprecited regardless of if they fit into the above!
